# A guide to model calibration

A simple implementation of two methods of calibrating machine learning models - Platt scaling and isotonic regression.
For the main notebook with a demo of the calibration on MNIST dataset, see [Notebook.ipynb](Notebook.ipynb). The modules used are contained in [model.py](model.py), [calibration.py](calibration.py), and [plotting.py](plotting.py).

For a short description of fitting a logistic regression line using linear regression, see [Sigmoid regression.ipynb](Sigmoid%20regression.ipynb).
